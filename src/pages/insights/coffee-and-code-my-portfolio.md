# Coffee & Code: My Portfolio

## Why I Built It

Building a web portfolio isn't just about putting projects online—it's about creating a space that reflects both my technical skills and my personality. I wanted something more than a static resume. I wanted a living website that tells my story as a developer and as a person.

## How I Shaped My Design

Every project starts messy. My portfolio began with scattered sketches, moodboards, and a lot of trial and error. I explored different layouts, typography, and color palettes until I found something that struck a balance between clean, modern design and personal expression.

## Tools I Use

For the foundation, I chose Astro because of its speed and simplicity. Styling was powered by Tailwind CSS/SCSS/etc. and ready made components using ShadCn, which gave me flexibility without slowing me down. I deployed it on Cloudflare, making updates quick and painless. Each choice was intentional—I wanted tools that were efficient, scalable, and fun to use.

## The Challenges (And the Fixes)

No build is perfect. I wrestled with responsive design, performance, accessibility, icons, etc., and every bug felt like a puzzle. For example, when I hit issues with layout shift, component conflict and deploying it on Cloudflare, I had to dig into documentation, experiment, and sometimes scrap entire approaches before landing on the right solution. These challenges made the portfolio more than just a showcase—they made it a learning journey.

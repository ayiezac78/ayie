## Why I Built It

Building a web portfolio isn't just about putting projects online—it's about creating a space that reflects both my technical skills and my personality. I wanted something more than a static resume. I wanted a living website that tells my story as a developer and as a person.

## How I Shaped My Design

Every project starts out a little messy. I'm not a designer by trade, but I love using my imagination to sketch and experiment with a minimalistic style. There's always a bit of trial and error — exploring different layouts, typography, and color palettes until I find that sweet spot between clean, modern design and personal expression.

## Tools I Use

For the foundation, I chose Astro because of its speed and simplicity. Styling was powered by Tailwind CSS/SCSS/etc. and ready made components using ShadCN, which gave me flexibility without slowing me down. I deployed it on Cloudflare, making updates quick and painless. Each choice was intentional—I wanted tools that were efficient, scalable, and fun to use.

## The Challenges (And the Fixes)

No build is perfect. I wrestled with responsive design, performance, accessibility, icons, etc., and every bug felt like a puzzle. For example, when I hit issues with layout shift, component conflict and deploying it on Cloudflare, I had to dig into documentation, experiment, and sometimes scrap entire approaches before landing on the right solution. These challenges made the portfolio more than just a showcase—they made it a learning journey.

## Adding the Finishing Touches

Once the structure was solid, I focused on polish. Animations, hover effects, subtle transitions—small details that bring the site to life. I wanted visitors not just to browse, but to feel the flow of the site.

## What I Learned Along the Way

This project taught me more than just technical skills. I learned how important it is to design with intention, to keep things simple, and to let personality shine through the work. My portfolio isn't just a site—it's a reflection of my growth, and it will keep evolving as I do.
